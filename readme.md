# Creative Commons Licenses in Markdown

These are some creative commons license files in markdown to add to your projects. They're forked from [@idleberg](https://github.com/idleberg)'s [Creative-Commons-Markdown repo](https://github.com/idleberg/Creative-Commons-Markdown). 

Following is the original readme file form [@idleberg](https://github.com/idleberg). I use this repo for personal purposes. 

I've just changed the extensions of the files for the sake of conformity with my other files.

On November 25th, 2013, [Creative Commons](http://creativecommons.org/) announced their next generation licenses: [Creative Commons 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/40768). By default, these are available as [HTML](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) or [plaintext](http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/41127). This project adds [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)-formatted licenses to that list, while aiming for best [compatibility on GitHub](https://github.github.com/gfm/).

## Licenses

## File extension

\* ***As I've mentioned before I've decided to change the extensions to `.md` again, so this section doesn't have much sense here but for the sake of knowing why they decided to use the full word as extension***. 

There's a plethora of Markdown file extensions, but I have decided to go with `markdown`. Read why:

*"We no longer live in a 8.3 world, so we should be using the most descriptive file extensions. It’s sad that all our operating systems rely on this stupid convention instead of the better creator code or a metadata model, but great that they now support longer file extensions."*  
Hilton Lipschitz ([via](http://hiltmon.com/blog/2012/03/07/the-markdown-file-extension/))

*"…the only file extension I would endorse is “.markdown”, for the same reason offered by Hilton Lipschitz"*  
John Gruber, creator of Markdown ([via](http://daringfireball.net/linked/2014/01/08/markdown-extension))

## Usage

There are other ways to get the licenses than downloading the [latest release](https://github.com/idleberg/Creative-Commons-Markdown/releases/latest) in your browser:

```bash
# Use git
$ git clone https://github.com/idleberg/Creative-Commons-Markdown cc-md

# Yarn
$ yarn add cc-md

# npm
$ npm install cc-md

# Bower
$ bower install cc-md
```
